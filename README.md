# Ferrers Model

This is a github repo for the MilkyWay Bar model with a slow, long, Ferrers bar based on results from [Wegg et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.4050W).

In this project, you can find two .py modules FerrersModel and HYuPlot with classes and methods helpful for orbit integration and plotting.

The potential and potential gradient with a rotating Ferrers bar and a logarithmic disk/bulge/halo is written in kcf_L4_mod.py. some configurations are stored in config.

A basic tutorial is provided in Tutorial.ipynb.

To include kinematics data from GALAH, download [the dynamics VAC](https://cloud.datacentral.org.au/teamdata/GALAH/public/GALAH_DR4/catalogs/galah_dr4_vac_dynamics_240705.fits).

More details of the methods and previous results using this model can be found at our paper.
